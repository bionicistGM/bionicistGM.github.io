Finally got around to putting this together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. 
Thanks to Jonathan McGlone for putting together a cool tutorial to follow: http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/
Total time to build this = 1 Hour
My goal is to have this website serve many purposes. As a go-to resource to find out more about me, my work, as an electronic lab notebook (ELN), a connection to my photography projects, and to different skills that I pick up along the way - hopefully they can save some time for those of you who are interested in something similar.

ELN's are amazing. I am fascinated by a few approaches. Check them out here:
